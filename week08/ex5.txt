The physical address is an address in the RAM (in hardware). Kernel is
responsible for managing physical memory, creating an abstraction for
user-space processes, known as virtual memory.

The virtual address is an address with respect to the process. Process doesn't
have access to the physical addresses, it can only access its own virtual
address space (unless this is some low-level software for working with RAM
directly). Usually process can assume that virtual address space is much
larger that physical address space, since kernel can swap pages of virtual
memory to the disk.
