memsize = 2^16 = 65 536                  | 65636
pagesize = 8192 = 8 192                  | 8192
entries_count = memsize / pagesize = 8   | 8


To obtain the amount of entries needed to cover all memory space in pages,
we need to divide size of address space by size of one page. Thus, we get
the answer of 8.
